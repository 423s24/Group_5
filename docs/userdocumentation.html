    <h1>User Documentation</h1>
    <h2>What is it</h2>
    <p>Our website allows you to submit a maintenance request form online. This is here to serve as an alternative to having to submit maintenance request forms in person with a physical document. This is not only convenient for tenants, but it is also more accessible to tenants that are unable to write, need a screen reader, or have challenges when it comes to physically going to the central office.</p>

    <h2>How to access</h2>
    <p>Our website will be accessed by going to <a href="https://tanrtech.com/">https://tanrtech.com/</a>. This address may change in the future.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <h3>Login and Sign Up</h3>
    <p>Upon accessing the website, the website will ask you to login or sign up. Click on the link that says "Login", and you'll be taken to the 
        login screen. Here, you can enter your username or password in order to log in.
          If you need to create an account, you can click the link labeled “Here!” to create an account. If you choose this option, the site will 
          ask for a first name, last name, username, email, password, and a second password field to verify your password. The site also displays 
          information for what must be in your password. Upon creating your account, you will be redirected to the main page, where you can then 
          log into your account and access the rest of the site. Alternatively, on the login screen, you can choose to reset your password. The site 
        will ask you for your password, and it will send you an email with information on how to reset your password.</p>
    <h3>Maintenance Request Form</h3>
    <p>On the dashboard, the maintainence request form is easily accessible by clicking the symbol of the piece of paper with a plus sign inside of it.
         When clicked on, it brings up a page where 
        information can be entered. It will ask for a first name, last name, phone number, address, unit, building, if Personnel Conducting 
        Maintainence can enter if you are absent, and what you are requesting maintenance for. 
        Once this info is filled out, you can click submit, and the information will be submitted to HRDC. You will then be taken to a page summarizing the
    information you entered.</p>
    <h3>Side Bar</h3>
    <p>The bar on the side of the page allows you to easily navigate between the different pages of the site. As a normal user, all that's available are the dashboard,
         accont information, support, and a button to logout. As an admin, you'll also have access to page that lists all users, another that lists all requests, 
         and another that lists all buildings. On all of these, there's a search function that lets you search through any field you want in order to find the piece of 
         information you want.
    </p>

    <h2>Reporting an Issue</h2>
    <p>To report an issue, navigate to the Github page for the project. Select the tab that says "issues", and you can open an issue that we can see and fix. 
        You'll have to create a Github account before you can submit an issue. Once we see an issue, we will proceed to either work to fix the issue, or we will
    determine it to be normal behavior and close the issue.</p>
