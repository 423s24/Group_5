    <h1>User Documentation</h1>
    <h2>What is it</h2>
    <p>Our website allows you to submit a maintenance request form online. This is here to serve as an alternative to having to submit maintenance request forms in person with a physical document. This is not only convenient for tenants, but it is also more accessible to tenants that are unable to write, need a screen reader, or have challenges when it comes to physically going to the central office.</p>

    <h2>How to access</h2>
    <p>Our website will be accessed by going to <a href="https://tanrtech.com/">https://tanrtech.com/</a>. This address may change in the future.</p>

    <h2>How to Use</h2>
    <h3>Login and Sign Up</h3>
    <p>Upon accessing the website, the website will ask you to login or sign up. If you try to access the housing or management tabs at this time,
         or click the link that says “Login”, you will be redirected to a login page. Here, you can enter your username or password in order to log in.
          If you need to create an account, you can click the link labeled “Here!” to create an account. If you choose this option, the site will 
          ask for a first name, last name, username, email, password, and a second password field to verify your password. The site also displays 
          information for what must be in your password. Upon creating your account, you will be redirected to the main page, where you can then 
          log into your account and access the rest of the site.</p>
    <h3>Maintenance Request Form</h3>
    <p>On the main site, there are two separate forms immediately available. These 2 forms are accessible by clicking either “Maintenance” or 
        “Application” in the top bar of the website. The first form is the maintenance request form. When clicked on, it brings up a page where 
        information can be entered. It will ask for a first name, last name, address, what you are requesting maintenance for, and a phone number. 
        Once this info is filled out, you can click submit, and the information will be submitted to HRDC.</p>
    <h3>Application Form</h3>
    <p>The second form available on the site is an application form. When clicked on, this will bring up a page where information can be entered. 
        It will ask for a first name, last name, the unit you are requesting, and a phone number. Once this info is filled out, you can click submit, 
        and the information will be submitted to HRDC.</p>
    <h3>Return Home</h3>
    <p>From both pages with the forms, you are able to return to the homepage of the site by clicking “return home” in the top left corner.</p>
    <h3>Your Dashboard</h3>
    <p>Your Dashboard is a convenient way to manage maintenance requests, see the status of applications, and to pay your bill. Users can see any 
        applications and requests that they submitted themselves. Superusers are able to see all applications and requests that have been submitted by anyone.</p>
    <h3>Creating an Account</h3>
    <p>To create an account hit the sign up link at the top right of the page or below the login fields. Enter a valid email address and create a 
        strong password. A link will be sent to you to validate your email address. If you are a tenant a manager will need to approve your account 
        before you can access tenant options (i.e. payment, maintenance request, etc.). If you are a manager you can enter an email to send a link 
        to a tenant to create their account.</p>

    <h2>Reporting an Issue</h2>
    <p>In the footer of the site there is a support link. Click it, go to the support page, and click the button to send a message. Fill out the 
        support form and click submit. Your message will be sent to a support mailbox where it will be processed.</p>
