    <h1>Developer Documentation</h1>
    <h2>Accessing Source Code</h2>
    <p>Latest released source code should be accessible on a public GitHub repository.
        The repository can be accessed here: <a href="https://github.com/423s24/Group_5">https://github.com/423s24/Group_5</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Planned Directory Structure</h2>
    <p>The directory structure will try to follow Django's filing structure. In our main project directory we will have Documentation, README.md, 
        and the following HousingPortal project. Within the project are the application files in Portal, and the general application files in the 
        subdirectory HousingPortal. The Portal folder should be the directory that will contain the files associated with the project i.e. html, 
        css, etc.</p>

    <h2>How to Build Software</h2>
    <h3>Dependencies</h3>
    <p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python</a></p>
    <p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/">PostgreSQL</a></p>

    <h3>Building the Software</h3>

    <p>To create the database if not done already, run the following command in the terminal: “createdb -h localhost -p 6000 -U postgres -W housingportal”</p>
        
    <p>This command creates the database on port 6000 where the project accesses it correctly, and as user “postgres”, if the user isn’t specified 
        postgresql will attempt to log in as the default user.</p>
        
    <p>This will create the database, now the database needs to be migrated, run “python manage.py migrate” then run “python manage.py makemigrations” 
        and that should set up the database for use. This will create a clean database, and does not include any data entries.</p>
        
    <p>To build the software, you must be in the main folder that contains the manage.py file. In the command line/terminal of the folder that contains 
        manage.py run the following command: “python manage.py runserver”.</p>
    
    <h2>How to test the software</h2>
    <p>If the software properly starts up after following the above instructions, and the database is able to take in and retain information, 
        the software is working properly</p>

    <h2>How to set up automated build and test</h2>
    <p>Automated tests will run on Github any time a new commit is pushed. This should also be true for any branches made.</p>

    <h2>How to release a new version of software</h2>
    <p>Push source code to Github. Newest release can be build with the instructions above. If the steps for building the software changes at any time, the 
        new information will be in the Building the Software section of the documentation.
    </p>

    <h2>How to access the list of outstanding bugs and the list of resolved bugs</h2>
    <p>On the Github page for the project, select the "Issues" tab. A list of opened issues by developers and users can be viewed. Link to page <a href="https://github.com/423s24/Group_5/issues">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>How to set up the Database</h2>
    <p>Install PostgreSQL. Setup your database server with user ‘postgres’ and password ‘root’ (sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 
        'root';"). Create the database for the housing portal with the command “createdb -p 6000 -U postgres -W housingportal”. Once the database is 
        created go to the outer HousingPortal folder in a terminal window and type “python manage.py migrate” to create all the tables needed for Django. 
        If you change the model.py file you will need to run “python manage.py makemigrations” and then “python manage.py migrate”.</p>

    <h2>How to run the server</h2>
    <p>Go to the outer HousingPortal folder in a terminal window and type “python manage.py runserver”. It will be available in the browser at localhost:8000.</p>

    <h2>How to create a superuser</h2>
    <p>Go to the outer HousingPortal folder in a terminal window and type “python manage.py createsuperuser”. Follow the prompts to create a superuser.</p>

    <h2>Comments in source code</h2>
    <h3>Source code should have the following required comments:</h3>

    
        <p>Comment explaining the files relation to the project as well as the function of the file</p>
        <p>At minimum 1 comment per function to describe what the function does</p>
        <p>etc.</p>
